<h1>Sanjeev Namjoshi, Ph.D.</h1>

I am a machine learning engineer at [[VERSES.AI](https://www.verses.ai/)]. My theoretical research interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in the computational modeling and simulation of living systems. These research areas heavily overlap with a diverse number of fields including embodied cognition, control theory, robotics, complex systems analysis, neuroeconomics, and theory of mind.

I am most interested in bringing wider recognition and visibility to Active Inference research. I am in the processing preparing two textbooks, one on Active Inference and the other on Bayesian Mechanics, to be published by The MIT Press. Active Inference, and the more general [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle), provide a mathematical description of the brain and living systems that may be key to unlocking further progress toward [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) as well as numerous industrial applications in areas such as robotics, logistics, and autonomous vehicles. Since the beginning of 2023 I have led engagements with the [Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) who have kindly hosted my chapter presentations, code review, and feedback sessions for the work-in-progress textbook.
