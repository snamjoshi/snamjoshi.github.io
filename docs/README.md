# Sanjeev Namjoshi

I am a senior machine learning engineer at KUNGFU.AI, an AI services firm based in Austin, TX. I am currently in the final month of a 7-month sabbatical where I have focused on writing a textbook on Active Inference intended to bring wider recognition and interest to this field. At KUNGFU.AI my main research focus has been leading the development of image-based breast cancer risk-detection software using computer vision.

My research interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.
