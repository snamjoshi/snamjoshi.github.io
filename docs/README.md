I am a senior machine learning engineer at [KUNGFU.AI](https://www.kungfu.ai/) ([company bio](https://www.kungfu.ai/blog-post/kungfu-ai-welcomes-sanjeev-namjoshi)), an AI services firm based in Austin, Texas (United States) where I have focused on creating robust software that applies machine learning to medicine and healthcare. At KUNGFU.AI my most recent research focus has been leading the development of image-based breast cancer risk-detection software using computer vision. This project involved developing a deep learning model from over 30 terrabytes of image data and patient outcome data to provide calibrated risk scores looking ahead 5 years into the future. I am currently in the final month of a 7-month sabbatical where I have focused on writing a [textbook on Active Inference](faif.md), a research area in computational neuroscience.

Outside of industry, my theoretical research interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning for the computational modeling and simulation of living systems. These research areas heavily overlap with a diverse number of fields including embodied cognition, controla theory, robotics, complex systems analysis, neuroeconomics, and theory of mind. At the moment I am most interested in bringing wider recognition and interest to the Active Inference research community. Active Inference, and the more general [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle), provides a mathematical description of the brain and living systems, that may be key to unlocking further progress toward [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) as well as numerous industrial applications in areas such as robotics, logistics, and autonomous vehicles. Since the start of my sabbatical I have led engagements with the [Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) who has kindly hosted my weekly chapter presentations, code review, and feedback sessions for the work-in-progress textbook.
